### Config 

![](imgs/Setting.jpg)

the water surface texture i used is come from [AoE2HD](https://store.steampowered.com/app/221380/Age_of_Empires_II_HD/),so i can't include in the project.

also make sure to import the noise texture as a `normal map` in your project.

and mark the sunlight texture warp mode to Clamp.
